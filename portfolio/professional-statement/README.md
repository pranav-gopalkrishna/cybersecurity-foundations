# About Professional Statement
A professional statement is a introduction for a professional context (e.g. to potential employers) that briefly describes who I am, what I care about and what I can do as an aspiring cybersecurity professional. It allows me to showcase my _interest_ in cybersecurity, _work experience_, _knowledge_, _skills_, and _achievements_. Portfolios are more in depth than a resume, which is typically a 1-2 page summary of relevant education, work experience, and accomplishments.

# Professional Statement
I am an organised, meticulous and creative problem-solver deeply interested in upholding confidentiality, data integrity and accessibility for organisations and the people working in it. I value productivity, and am strongly motivated to protect it from malicious actors and compromising errors. I enjoy clarifying complex problem-statements by essentialising, simplifying and organising relevant needs, concepts and methods.
