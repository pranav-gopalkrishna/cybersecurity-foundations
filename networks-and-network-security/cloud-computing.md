# Definition
Use of remote (internet-accessed) computer and network resources.

---

This involves the use of:

- Remote servers
- Remotely run applications
- Remotely managed network services

"Remote"

=> Hosted on the internet instead of on local physical devices.

# Cloud Network
Collection of servers/computers that:

- Store resources and data in a remote data center
- Can be accessed via the internet

---

These servers/computers are referred to as being "in the cloud".

---

Given internet connectivity...

_CNs allow access online services and web apps from any location._


# Cloud Service Providers
## Offerings
- Offer cloud computing to maintain applications, e.g.:
    - On-demand storage
    - On-demand processing
- Also provide business and web analytics <br> _Organizations can use to monitor their web traffic and sales_

**NOTE**: On-demand => Customers only pay as needed.

## Categories of Provided Services
### Software-as-a-Service (SaaS)
- Software suites operated by the CSP
- One can use them remotely without hosting the software

### Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS)
- Virtual computer components offered by the CSP
    - Include virtual containers, computation and storage
    - Configured remotely through the CSP's API/web console
- Usable to run existing applications without much modification\*

---

\* They can be modified to take advantage of a CSP's unique:

- Availability
- Performance
- Security features

### Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS)
- Tools that application developers can use <br> _To design custom applications for their organisation_
- Custom applications are designed and accessed in the cloud <br> _Used for a companyâ€™s specific business needs_

# Software-Defined Network (SDN) in Cloud Computing
See: ["Software-Defined Network", _Network Concepts_](./network-concepts.md#software-defined-network)

---

For cloud networking, SDN tools are hosted on the CSP's servers.

# Benefits of Cloud Computing
**Reliability**:

- Availability of cloud services and resources are
- Security in connections are
- Frequent running of services

**Cost**:

- CSPs benefit from economies of scale
- Manage the following much more cost-effectively:
    - Install network components
    - Patch issues
    - Upgrade hardware/software

**Scalability**:

- On-demand service provision
- Easy allocation/deallocation of remote resources
